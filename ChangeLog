	* src/shares.c (shares_get_share_info_for_path): Oops, fix the
	GError assertion.
	(shares_get_share_info_for_share_name): Likewise.
	(add_key_group_to_hashes): Fix the sense of strcmp().

	* src/shares.c (DEBUG_SHARES): Add a debugging flag so that we
	call a stub program instead of "net usershare".

2006-01-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* src/shares.c (add_key_group_to_hashes): New helper function to
	get the share info out of a key file group.
	(refresh_shares): Call net_usershare_run() to get a GKeyFile out
	of "net usershare"; extract the share info groups from it.

2006-01-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* src/shares.c (refresh_shares): Return a GError.
	(refresh_if_needed): Likewise.
	(shares_get_path_is_shared): Take a GError argument; make the
	return value be a success condition.
	(shares_get_share_info_for_path): Likewise.
	(shares_get_share_name_exists): Likewise.
	(shares_get_share_info_for_share_name): Likewise.
	(shares_get_share_info_list): Likewise.
	(throw_error_on_refresh): New debugging variable.
	(shares_set_debug): Add an error_on_refresh argument.
	(refresh_shares): Throw an error if throw_error_on_refresh is set.
	(net_usershare_run): New function to run "net usershare" and parse
	its output into a GKeyFile.

	* src/nautilus-share.c (property_page_share_name_is_valid): Pass a
	GError to the shares.h functions.
	(file_get_share_status): Likewise.
	(create_property_page): Likewise.  Also, throw an error dialog if
	we can't get the sharing info.

2006-01-10  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* src/shares.c (refresh_if_needed): New function; refreshes the
	share list at a limited rate determined by an update counter and a
	timestamp.
	(refresh_shares): Took out of the #ifdef block along with its
	helper functions.
	(shares_get_path_is_shared): Call refresh_if_needed().
	(shares_get_share_info_for_path): Likewise.
	(shares_get_share_name_exists): Likewise.
	(shares_get_share_info_for_share_name): Likewise.
	(shares_modify_share): Likewise.
	(shares_get_share_info_list): Likewise.

2006-01-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* src/shares.[ch]: New files with small API that maintains a
	list of current shares and talks to Samba's utilities for
	modifying user shares.

	* src/nautilus-share.h: Removed the prototypes for
	nautilsu_share_get_type() and nautilus_share_register_type(); they
	are internal to nautilus-share.c now.

	* src/nautilus-share.c: Removed the d-bus includes.  Removed the
	global g_dbus.  Made all functions static except for the module
	API.  Put the unfinished share-editor stuff in an "#if 0".
	(nautilus_module_initialize): Remove the d-bus initialization
	code.  Pass NAUTILUS_SHARE_LOCALEDIR to bindtextdomain().
	(nautilus_share_get_file_items): Don't copy the file list.
	Instead, ref the fileinfo; release it when the menu item gets
	destroyed by using g_object_set_data_full().
	(get_fullpath_from_fileinfo): Assert that the fileinfo is not
	NULL.
	(PropertyPage): New PropertyPage structure, it holds all the
	fields for a property page (widgets, xml, etc.).
	(create_property_page): Create a PropertyPage and hook it to the
	appropriate widgets, so that we can keep track of them easily, and
	free their memory as appropriate.  Move all the widget fields from
	here to that structure.
	(free_property_page_cb): New callback; free the XML and other data
	when the property page's main widget is destroyed.
	(xml): Removed.  This should not be global!
	(g_sharename): Removed.  This should not be global!
	(create_property_page): Use g_filename_display_basename() to get
	the fallback name from the path; g_path_get_basename() would give
	us a string potentially not in UTF-8 encoding.
	(create_property_page): Pass the PropertyPage to the callbacks,
	instead of special-casing each one for strings or a file info.
	Connect to "changed" on the text entries, not "focus-out-event".
	(create_property_page): Connect the signal handlers *after*
	setting the initial widget states so that they don't interfere
	with the settings.
	(create_property_page): Don't set the ->active field in toggle
	buttons directly!  Call gtk_toggle_button_set_active().
	(create_property_page): Compute the string length from the entry
	with g_utf8_strlen(); not plain strlen().
	(commit_property_page): New function; take a PropertyPage and
	commit its properties to the shares_*() functions.
	(on_checkbutton_share_rw_ro_toggled): Use commit_property_page().
	(left_share_name_text_entry): Fix the prototype; this was taking
	the wrong event type.  Now it gets passed a PropertyPage in the
	user_data.  Use commit_property_page().
	(property_page_set_sensitivity): New helper function.
	(on_checkbutton_share_folder_toggled): Use
	property_page_set_sensitivity().  Use property_page_commit().
	(property_page_set_error): Renamed from set_error().  Take a
	PropertyPage rather than a widget.  Take an error message; we'll
	get this in the GError from the backend.
	(property_page_set_warning): Renamed from set_warning().  Take a
	PropertyPage rather than a widget.
	(property_page_set_normal): Renamed form set_normal().  Take a
	PropertyPage rather than a widget.
	(validate_fields): New helper function.
	(create_property_page): Connect to "changed" on the name entry
	instead of "key-release-event".
	(property_page_share_name_is_valid): New helper function.
	(modify_share_name_text_entry): Use property_page_share_name_is_valid().
	(left_share_name_text_entry): Likewise.
	(modify_share_name_text_entry): New callback.
	(file_get_share_status): Use the shares functions instead of the
	d-bus backend.
	(file_get_share_status_file): Remove redundant tests.

	* src/Makefile.am (libnautilus_share_la_CFLAGS): Don't define GNOMELOCALEDIR.

	* configure.in: Add "AM_GLIB_DEFINE_LOCALEDIR(NAUTILUS_SHARE_LOCALEDIR)".

	* ChangeLog: Start the ChangeLog.
